## Reading

Be familiar with the following.

- Tanaka and Conrad describe semi-direct products as split exact sequences. 

- Rotman proves a few technical results in group theory using module theory.

- For help with memorization, Peter has copied down relevant definitions and theorems from Dummit and Foote; his outline is included for the sake of completeness.

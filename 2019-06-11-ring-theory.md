title: "Odds and Ends: Ring Theory"
abstract:
	- This is an abbreviated (and highly personalized) study guide I've written to review ring theory as covered in MATH 6130, taught by Nat Thiem at the University of Colorado during Fall 2018. I have included material from Hiro Lee Tanaka's MATH 122 problem sets as taught during Fall 2014 and 2017. *Mistakes are my own.* Please send corrections to `colton.grainger@colorado.edu`.

## Ring theory

i. Let $R$ be a commutative ring and let $a$ be an element of $R$. Prove that the set $\{ra : r \in R\}$ is an ideal of $R$.

ii. Prove TFAE.

    a. $R$ is a field.
    b. $R$ has no proper ideals.
    c. $0$ is a maximal ideal in $R$.
    d. Every nonzero homomorphism of rings $R \to S$ is a monomorphism.

Elementwise

i. Let $R$ be an entire ring. If $ab = ac$ for $a \neq 0$ where $a,b, c \in R$, then show that $b = c$.

ii. Show that every finite integral domain is a field.

Quotient rings

i. Prove that an ideal $\fp$ is prime if and only if $R/\fp$ is entire.

ii. Let $p$ be a prime number. Show that the ring $\ZZ_p \cong \ZZ/p\ZZ$ is a field.

Mapping into rings

ii. Let $X$ be a set and let $R$ be a ring. Let $F$ be the set of all functions from $X$ to $R$. Let $x \in X$ and let $I$ be the ideal of all functions in $F$ vanishing at $x$. Prove that $I$ is a prime ideal if and only if $R$ is an entire ring.

Chinese remainder theorem

i. Let $m$ and $n$ be coprime integers. Prove that $\ZZ_{mn} \cong \ZZ_m \oplus \ZZ_n$.

Hierarchy theorems

i. State the "hierarchy theorem".
i. Describe one ring that serves as a "depth separation" at each level of the hierarchy.
i. Show that if $R$ is a PID then every ascending chain condition of ideals eventually stabilizes.
i. Define a BÃ©zout domain.
i. Let $R$ be a PID and let $a,b \in R \setminus \{0\}$. Show that there exists $d \in \mathrm{GCD}(a,b)$ such that $d = ra + sb$ for some $r,s \in R$.

Prime and maximal ideals

Let $R$ be a commutative unital ring. 

i. When is an ideal $\fp$ said to be prime? When is an element $p \in R$ said to be prime? 
i. Prove that a maximal ideal is prime.
i. Prove that every proper ideal is contained in a maximal ideal. (Zorn's lemma.)
i. Prove that an ideal $\fp$ is prime if and only if $R/\fp$ is entire.
i. Prove an ideal $\fm$ is maximal if and only if $R/\fm$ is a field.
i. Prove TFAE.

    a. $R$ is a field.
    b. $R$ has no proper ideals.
    c. $0$ is a maximal ideal in $R$.
    d. Every nonzero homomorphism of rings $R \to S$ is a monomorphism.

i. Define comaximality.
i. State the CRT for the integers and for a general 
i. [@DF04, number 7.4.33] Let $R$ be the ring of continuous functions $C_\RR([0,1])$. For each $c \in [0,1]$, let $M_c = \{f \in R : f(c) =0\}$. (Recall $M_c$ is a maximal ideal.)

    a. Prove that if $M$ is *any* maximal ideal of $R$, then there is a real number $c \in [0,1]$ such that $M = M_c$.
    b. Prove that if $b$ and $c$ are distinct points in $[0,1]$, thne $M_b \neq M_c$.
    c. Prove that $M_c$ is not equal to the principal ideal generated by $x-c$.
    d. Prove that $M_c$ is not a finitely generated ideal.

i. [@DF04, number 7.4.33] Let $R$ be the ring of continuous functions from $C_\RR(\RR)$.

    a. Let $I \subset R$ be the collection of functions $f(x)$ with *compact support*. Prove that $I$ is an ideal of $R$ that is not a prime ideal.
    b. Let $M$ be a maximal ideal of $R$ containing $I$ (properly). Prove that $M \neq M_c$ for any $c \in \RR$.

Irreducibility criteria

i. Define the field of fractions of an entire ring $R$.
i. State Gauss' lemma.
i. State the Eisenstein criterion.
i. Prove that prime elements are irreducible in an entire ring.
i. In a UFD, prove that irreducible elements are prime. 
i. Prove that if $F$ is a field, then $F[x]$ is a Euclidean domain (hint: use degree as a norm).

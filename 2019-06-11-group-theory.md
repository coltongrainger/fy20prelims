### Revisions ...

Work out and revise solutions to the following (perhaps previously assigned) exercises.

1. (Bruhat decomposition) Prove that the group of general linear $n \times n$ matrices over the field $\FF$ can be written as $$GL_n(\FF) = \bigsqcup_{ \omega \in S_n} B\omega B$$ where $B$ is the set of upper triangular matrices.

   *Sketch.* Let $B$ be the subgroup of upper triangular matrices in $GL_n(\FF)$. We want to choose double coset representatives from the set 
   $$B \backslash GL_n(\FF) /B = \{BgB | g \in G\}.$$
   
   Note that elementary matrices in $B$ perform row operations on elements $g \in GL_n(\FF)$. So, given an arbitrary $g \in G$, we choose $b \in B$ to maximize the number of leading $0$'s of the product $bg$. 
   
   But $bg$ might not be in upper triangular (generally, echelon) form, so find a permutation (matrix) $\omega \in S_n \le GL_n(\FF)$ such that $\omega bg \in B$. So $\omega bg = b' \in B$. But then $g = b^{-1}\omega^{-1}b' \in B\omega^{-1}B$, the double coset labelled by an element of the symmetric group.
   
   Are $B \omega B$ and $B \sigma B$ the same if $\omega, \sigma \in S_n$ and $\omega \neq \sigma$?
   
   Suppose $B \omega B$ and $B \nu B$ are equal where $\omega, \nu \in S_n$. Then there are upper triangular matrices $a,b \in B$ such that $\nu = a\omega b$, so $\omega^{-1}a^{-1}\nu \in B$. Here's the idea: the diagonal entries of an upper triangular matrix are unique. Hence if $\omega^{-1}a^{-1} \nu \in B$, then $\omega^{-1}\nu \in B$. Moreover, $\omega^{-1}\nu \in S_n \cap B = \{I\}$ (why?) so $\omega = \nu$.

2. As a corollary to the orbit stabilizer theorem, justify: Let $G$ be a finite group and $K$ a subgroup of $G$. (i) The number of elements in the conjugacy class of $x \in G$ is $\abs{G : C_G(x)}$, which divides $\abs{G}$; (ii) the number of subgroups of $G$ conjugate to $K$ is $\abs{G : N_G(K)}$, which divides $\abs{G}$; (iii) if $G(x_1),\ldots, G(x_n)$ are the distinct conjugacy classes  then $\abs{G} = \sum_{i=1}^n \abs{G: C_G(x_i)}.$ [@Hun74, chapter II.4]

   i. The set $G$ is partitioned into disjoint orbits under the conjugation group action of $G$ on its elements. By orbit-stabilizer, then, summing the index of each conjugacy class in $G$, we have $\abs{G}$. 
   ii. $G$ also acts by conjugation on the set of its subgroups. Now $N_G(K)$ is a subgroup of $G$, so by Lagrange's theorem, $\abs{N_G(K)}$ divides $\abs{G}$. Therefore $\abs{G : N_G(K)}$ divides $\abs{G}$.
   iii. $G$ is the disjoint union of such conjugacy classes.

3. Classify the thirteen isomorphism types of groups of order $56$. *See.* [@DF04, number 5.5.7] 

4. Prove that $G = \langle x, y : x^3 = y^3 = (xy)^3 = 1\rangle$ is an infinite group as follows. 

   Let $p$ be a prime congruent to $1 \mod 3$ and let $G_p$ be the non-abelian group of order $3p$. Let $a,b \in G_p$ with $\abs{a} = p$ and $\abs{b} = 3$. [@DF04, number 6.3.14] Verify that both $ab$ and $ab^2$ have order $3$. Show that $G_p$ is a homomorphic image of $G$. Argue that $G$ is therefore an infinite group, as there are infinitely many primes $p \equiv 1 \mod 3$. 
   i. Let $K$ and $L$ be groups, let $n$ be a positive integer, let $\rho \colon K \to S_n$ be a homomorphism and let $H$ be the direct product of $n$ copies of $L$. From [@DF04, number 5.1.8], we constructed an injective homomorphism $\psi$ from $S_n$ into $\Aut{H}$ by letting the elements of $S_n$ permute the $n$ factors of $H$. The compositions $\psi \circ \rho$ is a homomorphism from $G$ into $\Aut{H}$. The *wreath product* of $L$ by $K$ is the semidirect product $H \rtimes_\psi K$ with respect to this homomorphism and is denoted by $L \wr K$. Note this wreath product depends on the choice of permutation representation $\rho$ of $K$ --- if none is given explicitly, then $\phi$ is assumed to be the left regular representation of $K$. [@DF04, number 5.5.23]
   
   (a) Assume $K$ and $L$ are finite groups and $\rho$ is the left regular representation of $K$. We find $\abs{L \wr K}$ in terms of $\abs{K}$ and $\abs{L}$.
   
   (b) Let $p$ be a prime, let $K = L = Z_p$. Suppose $\rho$ is the left regular representation of $K$. Then $Z_p \wr Z_p$ is a non-abelian subgroup of order $p^{p+1}$ and is isomorphic to a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $S_{p^2}$. [The $p$ copies of $Z_p$ whose direct products makes up $H$ may be represented by $p$ disjoint $p$-cycles; these are cyclically permuted by $K$.]

5. Let $p$ be a prime, let $P$ be a $p$-subgroup of the finite group $G$, let $N$ be a normal subgroup of $G$ whose order is relatively prime to $p$, and let $\bar{G} = G/N$. With Frattini's argument, prove $\N { \bar{G} } { \bar{P} } = \overline{\N G P}$. In addition, prove $\N{\bar{G}}{\bar{P}} = \overline{\N G P}$. [@DF04, number 6.1.20]

6. Write a program to compute the number of conjugacy classes in $S_n$. What is the largest n for which your program will work? <http://abstract.pugetsound.edu/aata/actions-exercises-programming.html>
